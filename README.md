Follow the steps below to complete the code challenge:

[x] Create a <button> element on the DOM
    you may do this in jQuery, or write it directly in the HTML code.
    Have the button text read Generate.

[x] Using jQuery, append a <div> element when you click the button.

[x] Inside the <div> element you created in the previous step,
    create a <p> element that
    shows how many times you have clicked the button from the first step.

[x] Inside the <div> element you created in step two,
  append two <button> elements.
  The text of the two buttons should read Swap and Delete.

[x] In a CSS file, any <div> created using the Generate button should have a Red background-color.

[x] Clicking a Swap <button> should change its parent background-color from Red to Yellow.

[x] Clicking a Delete <button> should remove its parent <div> container (and all of its contents).
